Hey! I'm PandanProgrammer (I couldn't think of anything else right now) and I'm practically a surface / beginner level programmer, but that
just means i'm always **always** open for new experiences or lessons about stuff from others!

I hope you "enjoy" whatever I put on here that you decide to check out!

And if you have any notes or feedback that can help me become a better programmer you can email me at
